#### [Gyazo](http://gyazo.com/)

Gyazo for Mac was first developed by Toshiyuki Masui

Gyazowin was developed by [tnj](http://nothing.sh/blog/archives/44)

##### Updates by [zzeneg](https://github.com/zzeneg):
- Support for uploading all file types. The file should be passed as an argument for the app (drag-n-drop, "Open with..." or "Send To...")
- Support for private uploaders - you can set an authentification token for client and server

These features should be supported by server. I've developed NodeJS [server](https://github.com/zzeneg/node-gyazo-upload), so you can use it.
